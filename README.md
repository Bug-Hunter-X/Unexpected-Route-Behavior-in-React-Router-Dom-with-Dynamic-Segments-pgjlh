# React Router Dom Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router Dom v6 related to unexpected behavior when navigating between routes with dynamic segments.  The issue manifests as incorrect component rendering or blank screens, often difficult to debug due to the asynchronous nature of routing.

## Problem Description

The application demonstrates unexpected behavior when navigating between routes with dynamic segments, even with seemingly correct route definitions. This often results in the wrong component being rendered, or a blank screen.  The issue may appear sporadically or under certain navigation conditions.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing route definitions and potential conflicts between route paths. In some cases, employing more specific or restrictive route paths to avoid overlapping behavior can resolve the issue.  Also, double check that you are correctly passing parameters.
